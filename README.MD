# About 
For this project I designed the datapath and the controller unit of a 16-bit multi-cycle processor.
Its instruction set architecture contains instructions for the following operations: load with direct addressing, load with immediate addressing, store, branch unconditional, branch with link, branch indirect, branch indirect with link, branch if zero, branch if not zero, branch if carry set, branch if carry clear, rotate right, rotate left, arihtmetic shift right, logical shift right, logical shift left, addition, subtraction, logical AND, logical OR, logical XOR, clear.
I validated its operation via microprograms that computes the 2's complement of a 1 byte number, calculates the sum of an array and determines the evenness/oddity of a 1 byte number.
